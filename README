Welcome to what is handsdown the worst web page you will ever come across.

Have you ever wondered what a page would look like if you randomised everything on it?

No...?

Well here it is anyway.

All the colours, fonts, images, and text(minus the instructions and heading) on this page are randomnly generated.
This makes the page the most uncomfortable and difficult to read page of all time.

Also to give you a reason to refresh and experience a whole rainbow of colours all over again, there is an animal matching game which displays an animal name and image on the screen.

You may be wondering why someone would dedicate any amount of time to doing something like this.

Unfortunately, I don't have an answer for that at this time, but at least my I learnt a bit while making it.
